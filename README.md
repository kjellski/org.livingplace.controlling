# LivingPlace.org Rule Engine

This project is part of my thesis about how to use Maven, OSGi and Drools in an laboratory environment for the livingplace.org project.
It's documentation and the intentions behind it are in my thesis which will later be found at [besteseitederwelt.de](http://users.informatik.haw-hamburg.de/~ubicomp/arbeiten/master/otto.pdf).

# Documentation

Most of the documentation will be found in my thesis, but if time permits, I would love to write some stuff down in the different modules as README.md as well.

# Installation

Check out this project and build it with:

    mvn clean install

# Run 

To run the project, since it's based on the pax ops4j toolsuite, this should be sufficient:

    mvn pax:run

# Ideas thoughts and what's wrong
